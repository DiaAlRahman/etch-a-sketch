# iSketch

An interactive etch-a-sketch app where users can draw by hovering their mouse pointer over the grid squares. The app is customizable, allowing users to modify the grid size dynamically. Challenge yourself to draw an apple!

## Features

- **Interactive Grid Drawing**:
  - The app tracks the pointer and marks any square that detects a mouse hover.

- **Customizable Grid**:
  - Users can adjust the grid size dynamically, enabling finer or coarser drawings.

- **Dynamic Event Management**:
  - Event listeners are added and removed seamlessly based on user options, ensuring smooth interactivity.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Front-End Development
- JavaScript
- Dynamic DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Grid Implementation**:
   - The primary challenge was constructing and updating the grid dynamically based on the desired size. The solution involved dividing the total height and width of the canvas by the number of cells to calculate appropriate dimensions for each square.

2. **Dynamic Event Listener Management**:
   - Used named functions for event listeners, which allowed for easier addition and removal of events when toggling options.
